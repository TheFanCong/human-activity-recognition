# human-activity-recognition
The layer-wise training convolutional neural networks using local loss for sensor based human activity recognition
The codes in this paper are all available and the codes include baselines and baselines with local loss. Besides, we also provide the processed human activity recognition(HAR) datasets to cite some instances conveniently (You don't have to download them, if you have processed corresponding datasets).
